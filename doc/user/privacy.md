## Frequently Asked Questions

### Are my files uploaded anywhere?
**No.** All processing takes place exclusively in your browser. Your files never leave your device.

### Is any data collected about me?
**No.** I don't collect any data about you or your usage. There is no analytics, no tracking, and no data collection.

### How does processing work without a server?
All processing runs in your browser using modern web technologies like Web Workers and WebAssembly. This enables fast, local processing without a server backend.

**During Conversion:**

**Browser Management:**

### What happens if I need to adjust settings during conversion?
- You can modify settings at any time
